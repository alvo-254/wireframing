## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a web page or application. It shows where key elements like buttons, menus, images, and text will appear — without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

### Why is Wireframing Important?

- Helps plan layout and user flow before development begins.  
- Saves time by identifying issues early in the design process.  
- Encourages feedback and collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- Serves as a blueprint for building user-friendly interfaces.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

### 1. Layout Structure  
Defines the overall arrangement of sections on a page (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).  
**Example:** A clear layout helps users find information quickly by organizing content logically.

### 2. Navigation  
Includes menus, links, or buttons that guide users through the app or website.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar with links to Home, Bookings, and Profile improves user flow.

### 3. Content Placement  
Shows where text, images, and other media will appear.  
**Example:** Placing a booking form near the top ensures it's visible and easy to access.

### 4. Functionality  
Represents interactive elements like buttons, search bars, or forms.  
**Example:** A visible “Book Now” button makes it easy for users to complete a reservation.
